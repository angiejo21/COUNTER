## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://counter.bello.codes)

Retro-Counter is the final project for [start2impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)'s module "JavaScript Basics" in the Full-stack developer course.

### The assignment:

Develop a JS app that lets the user increment or decrement the counter value. Entering the page, the user should see: 0 set as the counter value, and two buttons (+ and -) to change said value.

### Requirements:

- The app must be developed with JS, without the help of Jquery or any framework.
- The buttons, as well as the counter, have to be implemented through JS.
- Additional features may be added if necessary.

## Development

### The idea

The theme I chose is 90's videogames.

I set up the counter as a Gameboy with three buttons <strong>_+_ _-_</strong> and <strong>_RESET_</strong>; I gave them the iconic bulky look and chose a font that would fit the aesthetic: _Press Start 2P_. To create some dynamism, I added a moving background of repeated titles in gradient color.

I included sound and simple animation in each button:

- The display will "load" when starting the counter and during the reset,
- When pressed, an operator symbol will briefly bubble up or drop.

My <strong>main goal</strong> was for it to be <strong>responsive</strong> and <strong>user-friendly</strong>, meaning, even during stressing, the animations and sounds would end and reload without crashing.

The whole HTML structure is implemented through a JS function and the eventListener is placed on the buttons wrapper in order to use the Event Delegation.

### Built With

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
